# Bill Splitter

## Purpose
BillSplitter is an app that allows users to input the bill total along with each individual's amount spent at a restaurant and the app will manually split the tax/tip evenly among the people. This will help simplify a lot of the calculation processes that occur during bill splitting.

## Details and User Roles
Users can create an account on the register page by inputting an email and password which will then be stored in our firebase database. All future bills created by this user will be linked to their email in firebase and will be displayed on their profile page under bill history. Users can also add other registered emails to the bill which will then allow them to collaborate on the same bill from their respective devices.
